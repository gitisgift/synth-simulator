Earth data from:

Earth at night (I'm using night-time light as a proxy for population)

Then in Photoshop:
1) "Enhance/Adjust Lighting/Levels" and set Blue channel to zero
2) Convert to Greyscale
3) Adjust Lighting (ctrl+L) and set black level to about 36 and white to 248, to eliminate sea/arctic and stretch to full-white


The projection of this image maps the globe to fill a rectangle.
Mercator is the most obvious such projection, but it's not that.
Gall-Peters seems to be a better fit.
But it's probably a "Plate-Carree" projection: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equirectangular_projection



From the Wikipedia link:

If (x,y) is the point on the map:
latitude = y
longitude = x / cos(latitude)
